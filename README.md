DigiLocker PlatformA secure cloud-based platform for issuance, storage, sharing, and verification of digital documents and certificates, aimed at achieving Paperless Governance.✨ Key FeaturesVerifiable Documents: Provides direct access to authentic documents (e.g., Driving License, RC, Academic Marksheets) issued by registered Government agencies (Issuers).Legal Validity: Documents fetched via the platform are legally equivalent to physical documents under the IT Act, 2000.Secure Sharing: Enables secure, consent-based sharing of documents with verified institutions (Requesters) for various services.Aadhaar Integration: Uses Aadhaar (UIDAI) for secure identity linking and registration.Open APIs: Offers standard APIs for seamless integration by Requester organizations (e.g., Banks, Universities, Employers) to verify citizen documents.🏛️ Architecture OverviewThe DigiLocker ecosystem operates on a three-way trust model:Issuer: A government organization that provides digital documents (e.g., CBSE, RTO, UIDAI).Requester: An organization (public or private) that requests documents from the citizen for verification (e.g., a bank for KYC).Citizen: The end-user who consents to share their documents.The platform acts as a secure intermediary, facilitating the flow of verifiable data from the Issuer to the Requester, authorized by the Citizen.🔌 API Integration for RequestersInstitutions that need to verify documents can integrate with the DigiLocker API suite.ServiceDescriptionEndpoint ExampleDocument FetchRetrieve a specific document type (e.g., RC) for a consented user./pull/v2/rcURI VerificationVerify the authenticity of an uploaded document using its URI (Uniform Resource Identifier)./verify/v2/uriAuthenticationOAuth 2.0 flow for citizen authentication and consent./auth/oauth2/authorizePrerequisites for IntegrationValid Client ID and Client Secret obtained by registering as a Requester organization.Secure Redirect URI for the OAuth flow.Compliance with Consent-Based Sharing protocols.📚 Getting Started with the APITo integrate DigiLocker verification into your application:Register: Apply to become a Requester organization on the Developer Portal.Setup OAuth: Implement the OAuth 2.0 flow to get the user's access token after they grant consent.Call API: Use the obtained access token to call the required document pull or verification APIs.JSON# Example API Call (Conceptual)
